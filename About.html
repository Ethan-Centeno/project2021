        <h2>Subject Background</h2>
        <p>My name is Ethan Centeno and I am a junior attending Santa Ana High School. My background in STEM includes completion of the CompTIA A+ Essentials Hardware course. Currently, I am enrolled in the CompTIA A+ Essentials Software course and I intend to acquire the CompTIA A+ Certification. During the summer of freshman year, I was enrolled in an intro to Python course provided by CTE, and acquired a certificate of completion. Prior PLTW courses I have taken include Robotics (eight grade) and Principles of Engineering during my sophomore year. I am taking PLTW Software Engineering in order to expand my knowledge on the vast subject of computer science and explore my interests within the subject.</p>

        <h2>Blender</h2>
        <p>Recently, I have found an interest in 3D design. I have been using Blender, a 3DCAD software to make some digital pieces. Though, they do take an amateur appearance. Another one of my hobbies. Below is a link to my Reddit page where I occasionally post my work.</p>

        <h2>Film Photography</h2>
        <p>One of the few hobbies I picked up during quarantine was photography, specifically film photography. There is a certain charm to the grain of the photos. One builds a better connection to their photos provided the limitations within the medium. Below is a link leading to an album of all of my photos (including many of the bad ones). More recent photos will appear at the bottom of the page.</p>
        <p> -I hope you will notice an improvement in quality as you scroll down.</p>

        <h2>Track and Field / Cross Country</h2>
        <p>Track and Cross Country provided an outlet for me to truly free myself from the real world, and there I could focus on nothing but myself and my success. The sport helped me sculpt a mindset of a hard worker through the hard work and dedication needed in overcoming the many physical and mental obstacles the sport has to offer. Some of my best memories were with my team from Cross Country and Track.</p>
